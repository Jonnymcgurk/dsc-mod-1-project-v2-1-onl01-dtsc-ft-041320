# Module 1 Final Project

For this project we focused on the movie industry. We looked at data from:

- IMDB
- TMDB
- Box Office Mojo
- Rotten Tomatoes

Furthmore we scraped some additional data from imdb using beautiful soup 


# This readme is intended to help you navigate my project

Things you'll need to import, although its in the script its helpful to know that most of the notebooks use:

beautiful soup 

Data files youll need:

The base files are in the /zippedfiles folder
The files of the data we cleaned are in the /cleandata folder 


# Folder structure 
I have seperated my project into 5 questions, all can be found in FINISHED WORKBOOKS, the code i dont use or need and failed expeirments are in the folder beginning with JUNK CODE, This will be of little use to the reader other than so see what went wrong and early approches taken. 

within the FINISHED WORKBOOK section my questions are broken down as such:

Question1

Question2

Question3
